		Operators:
			Arithmetic Operators:

			Arithmetic operators apply to numeric values and yield a result of the same type as the first operand.
			The four standard arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) apply to integer, floating-point, and complex types;
			+ also applies to strings.

			Bitwise Operators:

			The bitwise logical and shift operators apply to integers only. Bitwise operator works on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation.
			- & bitwise AND
			- | bitwise OR
			- ^ bitwise XOR
			- &^ bit clear (AND NOT)

			Comparison operators

			Comparison operators like == and < can also be used to compare a value of a named type to another of the same type,
			or to a value of the underlying type. ==, <, >

			Logical Operators

			Logical operators apply to boolean values and yield a result of the same type as the operands.
			The right operand is evaluated conditionally.
			&&, ||, !=

			Assignment Operators

			Assignment statement that concatenates the old value of X with Y and assigns it back to X.
			X=X+Y
			X+=Y
			The operator += is an assignment operator. Each arithmetic and logical operator like + or * has a corresponding assignment operator.
